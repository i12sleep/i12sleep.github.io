    Hi I'm Brandon!<br>
    I am a student at UNSW studying a double degree in mathematics and computer science!<br>
    This website is for me to put some of my future and current projects and to include any other cool things I might want to add.<br>
    Any improvements or suggestions I should include would be appreciated :)
