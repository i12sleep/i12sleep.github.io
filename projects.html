        I am currently working on a very simple project for calculating the possibility<br>
	of getting a certain cost unit from the pool given some x amount of units out of the pool.<br>
	Other project ideas include: A basic calculator (with graphics hopefully). <br>
	Something league of legends related (I hope this does not come to backfire on me).<br>

	    Any other project ideas would be appreciated :)<br>
